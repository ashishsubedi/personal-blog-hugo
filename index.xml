I&amp;rsquo;m Ashish, a Junior Python Developer and Software Engineer. I&amp;rsquo;m currently a final year student of undergraduate in Computer Engineering.
For those who came upon this in a drunken stupor and don&amp;rsquo;t know where they are, this is my personal site where I will post about random things which may or may not be useful.
