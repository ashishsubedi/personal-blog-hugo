Hi! I'm Ashish, a Python Developer and Software Engineer. I graduated as a Computer Engineer from Kathmandu University in 2022 (2021 technically). 

For those who came upon this in a drunken stupor and don't know where they are, this is my personal site where I will post about random things which may or may not be useful. So, I welcome you here, where everything is about me and I am the center of the world. Hope you enjoy the things that come from my mind!
