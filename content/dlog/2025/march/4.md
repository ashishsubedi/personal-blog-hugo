Hey everyone, hope you're all doing great! A lot has been happening in my life—some exciting, some nerve-wracking. I’ll share more on that in another post, but for now, let’s talk about my (yet another) new project:  

**[Folder Manager for Google Docs](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/jgikcdimpmdoofakjbggakjhbpidjbeo?utm_source=item-share-cb)**—a simple Chrome extension that lets you organize your Google Docs into folders.  

## Why I Built This  

I use Google Docs **a lot**—it’s simple, fast, and minimalist, which I love. But when it comes to folder management? It sucks.  

Yeah, you can create folders in Google Drive, but the UI is painfully slow, and managing files is just… frustrating. There’s **no quick way to pin folders**, no easy access—nothing that makes organizing documents smooth.  

I looked for alternatives, expecting to find something decent. **Nope.** Nothing.

So, I decided to build one myself!  

## My Experience Using It  

Since I built this for myself first, I focused on the features I **actually needed**. After using it for **over two months**, I can confidently say:  

**I can’t go back to using Google Docs without it.**  

It just makes life easier. No more digging through Drive’s slow UI—just quick, easy folder management.  

So yeah, if Google Docs' folder system annoys you as much as it did me, give it a try! And if you do, let me know what you think.
