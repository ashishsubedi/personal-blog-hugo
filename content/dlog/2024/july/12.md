Hey readers, thanks for coming back here. While working on one of the bugfixes for a new project, I came across an interesting piece of code written by one of my colleague. The basic idea is of the problem is to get a value from dict with lots of nested objects, about 5-6 levels deep. There are quite a few variants of dict that we get, but for a variation, path of keys is same. For an example, consider the following dict.
```python
example = {
  "key1": {
    "key2": {
      "key3": [
        {
          "key4": {
            "required": "value"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}

```

Let's say we have multiple variants of the json with similar structure where you need to get the `required` value. One way to do it would be to directly get the data from the dict.
```python
example["key1"]["key2"]["key3"][0]["key4"]["required"]
```

While this is totally fine, doing this for many variation is tedious.

The following function I think is very good approach to make it easier.


```python
from functools import reduce
def get_value_from_dict(data: dict, path: Iterable[str | int]) -> Any:
    return reduce(lambda curr, key: curr[key], path, data)

```
And then function is called as below
```python

get_value_from_dict(example, ("key1", "key2", "key3", 0, "key4", "required"))

```
which I believe looks much cleaner and less tedious compared to previous approach.
